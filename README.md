The purpose of this project is to demonstrate how implement android projects by using Clean Architecture principles, MVVM pattern, Android best practices, Jetpack, and design patterns.
In future, I will add Jetpack Compose in a different branch.

It is less about the application and more about the code and architecture, programming principles and patterns.


- Threading by Coroutines
- Dependency Injection with Hilt
- Networking with Retrofit
- De/Serialization with Gson
- Image loading with Glide
- Writing code using Clean Architecture and MVVM pattern
- Using Kotlin
- Unit tests and TDD approach


I'm currently working on this project and I'm preparing an article. I will publish it in Medium.
